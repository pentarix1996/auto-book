## Starting ðŸš€

Auto Book is a tool that uses the power of GPT3 to generate short stories based on a given title, genre and synopsis

### Pre-requirements ðŸ“‹
- Python>=3.7.1
- Have an API Token to be able to access the [Openai](https://openai.com/) API
- Install "requirements.txt" python packages **python -m pip -r requirements.txt**
## How to use ðŸ“–

The first thing is to configure the properties.py file that is in the "configuration" directory. You must enter your OpenAI API token, your organization ID, then you must enter the title of the story to generate, a gerero and if you wish a synopsis (optional)


Finally run the script main.py **python main.py** and enjoy your literary work (you can continue it if you want)
